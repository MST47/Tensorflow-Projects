# Tensorflow-Projects
In this repository we will walk through 4 fundemental machine learning algorithms. We will apply each of these algorithms to unique problems and datasets before highlighting the use cases of each.

The algorithms we will focus on include:

Linear Regression
Classification
Clustering
Hidden Markov Models
It is worth noting that there are many tools within TensorFlow that could be used to solve the problems we will see below. I have chosen the tools that I belive give the most variety and are easiest to use.
