# Tensorflow-Projects
## Overview
This repository provides scripts and tools to build and train ML models. We will walk through 4 fundamental machine learning algorithms. We will apply each of these algorithms to unique problems and datasets before highlighting their use cases.

The algorithms we will focus on include:

**i.   Linear Regression:** Understand and implement linear regression for predicting continuous variables.   <br />
**ii.  Classification:** Build classifiers for categorizing data into distinct classes.      <br />
**iii. Clustering:** Use clustering techniques to group similar data points.   <br />
**iv.  Hidden Markov Models:** Explore temporal or sequential data using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).  <br />

It is worth noting that many tools within TensorFlow could be used to solve the problems we will see below. I have chosen the tools that I believe give the most variety and are easiest to use.
