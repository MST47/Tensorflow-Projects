# Tensorflow-Projects
## Overview
This repository provides scripts and tools to build and train ML models. We will walk through 4 fundamental machine learning algorithms. We will apply each of these algorithms to unique problems and datasets before highlighting their use cases.

The algorithms we will focus on include:

i.   Linear Regression  <br />
ii.  Classification      <br />
iii. Clustering   <br />
iv.  Hidden Markov Models  <br />
It is worth noting that many tools within TensorFlow could be used to solve the problems we will see below. I have chosen the tools that I belive give the most variety and are easiest to use.


### Features
**Automated Scripts**: Easily automate the use of multiple NLP models. <br />
